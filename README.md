# Karuko Solver
The [original challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3g2tby/20150807_challenge_226_hard_kakuro_solver/) said for a Kakuro Solver, but I mispelled and didn't bother fixing it. The solution is found through brute force, and was the outcome of a code-off where I tried to code a solution faster than my roommate could.

## Usage
```sh
$ javac Karuko.java
$ cat sample.txt | java Karuko
2
1

$ cat sample2.txt | java Karuko
1 5 
4 2 
8 1 

```
